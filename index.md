# About Me

<img src="/images/sousa.jpg" class="floatpic">

Here is **Luan Sousa**.<br>

I am Bachelor’s degree in Statistics and Data Science from the Federal University of Ceará (UFC), where I received a solid foundation in Statistics, Machine Learning, and Programming. I am proficient in Python and R, data retrieval and processing with SQL, predictive modeling using scikit-learn, and data visualization with Tableau, Matplotlib, and Seaborn.


I have worked and conducted research in Machine Learning (supervised and unsupervised learning) and Generalized Linear Models. Currently, I work on predictive modeling research using supervised learning to forecast outcomes in real-time electronic sports matches—specifically, League of Legends. I am constantly seeking to learn new concepts and techniques to apply them to real-world challenges, always focusing on generating value and meaningful insights.


If you are interested in any aspect of me, I am always open to discussions and collaborations. Feel free to reach out to me at - luansousa@alu.ufc.br
